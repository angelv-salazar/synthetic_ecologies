SYNTHETIC ECOLOGIES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND POST-NATURE WORKSHOP

This are colab notebbooks using StyleGAN2 to generate images. 
-a_prepare-dataset.ipynb :  Is for prepare the dataset, crop the center and conver to square images in 512x512 or 1024x1204 size. Also verify the images.
-b. StyleGAN2_train_model.ipynb :  is for train a machine learning model using stylegan2 based in transfer learning. It is better to start using images with a size of 512 px
-c. StyleGAN2_generator.ipynb :  generate images from the trained model and you can use them to create a video generating frames between images.
